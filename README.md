# project-bodega engineering & research department
building marketplace for (meta-creators)

Design Philosphy:

1. All Atoms, All independent
2. this git file lists all products project-bodega has to offer
3. django / python for backend. reactJS for frontend. 
4. I build the backend and the initial UI/UX wireframe
5. a talented frontend engineer was contracted for the the well frontend. 
6. I am currently working on CNN and maintenance code for the park to run smoothly. 
7. folder power --> backend(root) -> bdgmrkt (the marketplace / park) this is project name--> backend (name of the app we are making)
8. this allows independence and freedom for us engineers & scientists
9. as an AI Park, it allows us to release prpduct features catered to specific users and their use cases.
10. do not ask for admission in project-solomon - i will ask for you when the time comes. 
11. thanks fellow engineer for working with us. 


why the All Atoms and All Independent philosphy?
simple. 
first reason: less stupidity. as engineers & scientists we are always busy reverting that fault piece of code. its a frustrating process but imagine if the whole park goes dark. 
not good eh? this allows all hosts, guests to enjoy the experience without major outrages. 
second reason: we are an AI Park. so we use AI to be an efficient team. so all our work starts at our laptops and end it. being independent is secure. think like a octopus, with 8 hearts
third reason: we are a DAO. how can I say we are DAO if the source code is sitting in one file ready to be attacked? or if the algorithm is exposed?

how do we secure our systems? how do we secure our guests and hosts?
i have deployed an invisibility cloak the moment you sign in. 
private WAN, honeypots - so many small small tricks our teams are busy working on.
